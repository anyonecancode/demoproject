# Brewnotes -- a demonstration project

I find that in software development, _patterns_ are more important than specific implementations. That said, it's often nice to have a reference implementation for different patterns. In this project, I'm taking the same sample application, and implementing it in various ways. This serves a few different purposes:
- It gives me a chance to practice implementing the same pattern in different languages, honing both my understanding of the pattern and the language I'm doing the implementation in
- It serves as a reference I can easily look up, rather than trying to re-create something I know I did once upon a time for some project back in the day
- It gives me the chance to experiment with different patterns and technologies, and in doing so support both the previous points

The application I'm implementing in this project I've called _Brewnotes -- beers to try and beers I've tried_. It's a browsable and searchable catalog of beers, from which I create a personal library of beers I've tried and add notes. Basically, it's an app that let's me try out different styles of beer and serve as a reference for styles I've tried, which through building it let's me try out different software patterns and technologies and server as a reference for patterns and technologies I've tried...
